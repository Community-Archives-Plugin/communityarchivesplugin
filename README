# Community Archives Plugin

The Community Archives Plugin is a grant-funded project to extend Wordpress to function as a Community Archives Management tool. Community Archives are small, informal, usually unfunded archival collections by members of a community who are often unrepresented or misrepresented in dominant archives. 

We are looking for Open Source enthusiasts and Wordpress coders to help establish this open source project on Github. We will then work with paid and volunteer coders to execute the requirements of the project.
