# Community Archives Plugin

The Community Archives Plugin is a grant-funded project to extend Wordpress to function as a Community Archives Management tool. Community Archives are small, informal, usually unfunded archival collections by members of a community who are often unrepresented or misrepresented in dominant archives.
