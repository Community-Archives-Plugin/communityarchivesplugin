# Community Archives Plugin

The Community Archives Plugin is a grant-funded project to extend Wordpress to function as a Community Archives Management tool. Community Archives are small, informal, usually unfunded archival collections by members of a community who are often unrepresented or misrepresented in dominant archives. 

This project was inspired by the demonstrations that took place in 2020 after the death of George Floyd. This project is dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement. This project is committed to: 1) the use of archives for preserving and representing Black lives from a community perspective, 2) reparative justice and 3) a "people's history" that speaks truth to power. 

We are looking for Open Source enthusiasts and Wordpress coders to help establish this open source project on Github. We will then work with paid and volunteer coders to execute the requirements of the project.
